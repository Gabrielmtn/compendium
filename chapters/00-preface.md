# Preface


## Aim

This book aims to demystify the contents and apparent design of Dota 2 replay
files.

While the authors make their best effort to maintain accurate information,
replays often change without warning. We obviously have no say in Valve's
decision-making process; rather, we aim to describe what we know as of now.

If you encounter any inconsistencies or incorrect information--or if you are
confused about the presentation of concepts--please join the authors in
\#dota2replay on Quakenet IRC. *We appreciate your understanding that
responding takes time; sometimes, a day or more.*

Once you have exhausted this option, feel free to create a
[new github issue](https://github.com/skadistats/compendium/issues/new) asking
for clarification.


## Intended Audience

Since you are reading this, you are probably some combination of the
following:

- a Dota 2 player
- a software developer or enthusiast hacker
- literate and curious

The authors of this book assume that you are, at the very least, familiar with
basic Dota 2 game mechanics. If you are a developer, even better. Some basic
knowledge of computer science principles will help immensely in understanding
Dota 2 replays.

A few examples:

- [recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
- [polymorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism)
- [inheritance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29)

For the sake of expediency, the authors use these concepts with minimal
explanation. If you've never encountered these ideas, some of the book's
contents might be challenging.

Even if you're not particularly technical, give it a try.
