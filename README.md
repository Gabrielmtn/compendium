# Compendium

A collaborative, community effort to document Dota 2 replay (aka "demo")
files, including:

- basic, requisite Source engine concepts
- replay format/structure
- semantic definitions of entity data (e.g. what the data mean, specifically,
with ample context)
- the evolution of replays with time (they do change sometimes with patches!)

This project will be maintained as an ebook, of sorts. Pull requests are most
welcome, but should be submitted on a topic branch, and may be edited for
informational or style purposes.

It is an explicit goal of this project *not* to contain code samples for any
of the major replay parsers. Rather, we aim to explain things conceptually.
Replay data access will differ by parser implementation, but with solid
understanding, developers will easily figure out what to do.

Eventually, there will be formal style guidelines. They will be mandatory, but
as simple and consistent as possible.
